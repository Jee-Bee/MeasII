Meas MkII
=========

The project introduction
------------------------

[Meas](https://github.com/Jee-Bee/Meas "Meas") is a project i started to understand more about the concepts of programming, accoustics and sound processing.
In Meas MkII i add the understanding of UML diagramming.

Installing
----------

The required software for the UML diagrams is:
- Qt Designer

The expected required software are:
- Python 3
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Matplotlib
- Sounddevice
- Qt / PySide

Status
------

Currently only the UML part is added. I have to check what part of Meas MkI is reusable and based on that i add that too.
I don't expect that there is a stable version any time soon.
For tips tricks or fault in usage of UML diagrams, or programming tips feel free to contact me.
